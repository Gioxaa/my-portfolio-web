- Don't change existing standards or patterns established in the codebase
- Maintain consistent code formatting throughout the project

## Component Structure

- All components should follow React functional component pattern
- Use TypeScript typing for all props and state
- Component files should be organized with imports, component definition, styles (if using CSS-in-JS)

## Styling Approach

- Use the existing CSS variables defined in [styles/globals.css](mdc:styles/globals.css) for consistency
- Follow the established class naming conventions
- Maintain responsive design principles for all screen sizes

## Technical Standards

- Use Next.js conventions for page routing and data fetching
- Leverage React Bootstrap components where appropriate, consistent with existing usage
